# CustomTkinter Trial Repository

This repository is a trial space for exploring and understanding the functionalities of `customtkinter`, a Python library that provides custom widgets for the Tkinter GUI toolkit.

## About the Code

The main script, `main.py`, demonstrates the use of `customtkinter` to create a simple login interface. It includes a `login` function that simulates a login process, and uses `customtkinter` widgets to create a user interface with username and password fields, a login button, and a "Remember me" checkbox.

## Running the Code

To run the code, navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py# CustomTkinter Trial Repository
```

This will start the Tkinter GUI application.
